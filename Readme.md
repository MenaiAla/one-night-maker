One-Night-Maker is a collection of one-night projects created by Menai Ala Eddine. Each night, a new project was born from a combination of curiosity, creativity, and passion for software development. Each project is unique and can be used as a reference for learning or inspiration. The projects were created using different technologies and frameworks. Feel free to explore the projects and use them for your own learning and development.

This project was created with the aim of providing junior developers with a platform to contribute to open-source projects and learn from them. It can be challenging for junior developers to find projects to work on and gain practical experience. Therefore, this project serves as a resource for them to get hands-on experience in building web applications using popular technologies

By contributing to this project, junior developers can improve their skills and collaborate with other developers in the community.
